## Project
This project is yet-another clone of Udemy

## Alternatives / Market research
Our project is an educational platform that will help students and teachers to facilitate the learning process. After studying alternative platforms, our team came to the conclusion that all online platforms are traditionally used in the educational field, although they are rather inconvenient. For example, [Google Classroom] is used in educational organizations,
there are all the traditional features (publishing lecture material, homework, comments), but many users complain about inconvenient class link, users also need to have a Google account.
[Moodle] also has all the traditional features, but the best visual tracking of the progress of the learning material. But it also has many disadvantages, the platform is difficult to learn and not intuitive, difficult to develop and change. There is also a platform in which the author of the material can put a price. For example, [Udemy], in which there are all the functions as in the platforms presented earlier. The biggest plus is that 90% of the material is video. The project will take the best of the alternatives, such as design, homework uploads and lectures and video tutorials.

## Non-Functional requirements


 - The application must be built on Java
 - The application must work in all modern browsers
 - The application must be responsive (work well and look good on all screen sizes)


## Risks
Our chat and streaming engine, which is a key differentiator for our startup, can be tricky to code.

## Mockups, Wireframes
*Put here images of your wireframes*

## Future iterations
In the future, you can also add the ability to add tests and students to share the screen
